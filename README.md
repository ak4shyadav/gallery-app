# gallery-app

I've created a comprehensive Flickr image gallery mobile app that meets all your requirements. The app features a beautiful, Instagram-like design with intelligent caching, smooth pagination, and robust search functionality.

The app includes two main screens accessible via bottom tabs - Home for recent photos and Search for finding specific images. The caching system stores image URLs in AsyncStorage and implements smart refresh logic that only updates when the API response changes, just like Instagram. The pagination system smoothly loads more photos as you scroll, with loading indicators and proper error handling including retry snackbars for network failures.

Key features implemented include offline support through intelligent caching, smooth infinite scroll with loading states, real-time search with debouncing, beautiful image grid layout with loading skeletons, and comprehensive error handling with retry functionality. The design follows modern mobile app patterns with clean typography, smooth animations, and a professional color scheme optimized for the mobile experience.
